  "body": "### Welcome\r\nPokébot is a bot for Pokémon battles in discord, built using the [Discord4J](http://austinv11.github.io/Discord4J/) framework. It has only the core gameplay, as in YOU are the Pokémon. There are none to catch and evolve, and no Pokémon is better than another. You are free to create whatever combinations you want! Using either commands or the responsive web interface, it's easy to set any stats, moves, abilities, level, and natures you want!\r\n\r\n### How can I use it?\r\nThere's an official bot up, which can be added from [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=200764061653139466&scope=bot&permissions=84992 \"Authorize Pokébot\"). You can find information about how to use it [here](https://github.com/Coolway99/Discord-Pokebot/wiki).\r\n\r\n### Preventing OP\r\nTo help prevent someone from choosing only the \"best\" moves and maxing their stats, there's this concept of Points. You can only have so many points, and going over them prevents you from doing the fun stuff. Feedback is appreciated by telling me either here (@Coolway99) or on discord (Coolway#7694).\r\n\r\n### What's planned\r\nIt may seem small at first, but Pokébot already has a lot to offer. More Moves and Abilities are being added all the time, with Items, team battles, \"slots\" and \"slot\" battles (which are more like the traditional battles), and much more! Leaving feedback for an idea is a sure way to get it added.\r\n",
